# potato-disease-image-classification-using-cnn
This project classifies potato leaf health using CNNs, processing images from the PlantVillage dataset into three categories: healthy, early blight, and late blight. Key features include data augmentation, preprocessing, and a custom CNN for accurate classification. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and Python, it aids farmers in early disease detection.
